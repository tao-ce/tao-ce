This directory contains some oddly evident shortcuts taken in development; which should be released before public release

* [task management](./tasks/)
    - some common tasks should be considered in applications lifecycle. As there is still a lot of moving parts, they are temporarly kept here but might be moving to a more suitable places soon or later
  
* [artifacts management](./artifacts/)
    - some building script/resources are quite experimental and may need to be stabilized before release.
